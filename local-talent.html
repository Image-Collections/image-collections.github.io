<div>[...intro by TM Maple Leaf...]</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here, on this page, are <span style="color: #ff0000;">some of the people you may wish to aspire to be</span> like...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most of them, <span style="color: #ff0000;">possibly like you</span>, have had <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreams</span> to reach out by harvesting from within, taking stands by <span style="color: #ff0000;">giving the world</span> pieces &amp; places of themselves they thought had long sat dormant enough...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Like many <span style="color: #ff0000;">reading this</span>, they had been <span style="color: #ff0000;">spawning ideas</span>, sometimes only every now &amp; then, sometimes daily or hourly...sometimes hundreds of them, sometimes only a couple, or even, just perhaps, only <span style="color: #ff0000;">one</span>....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The quantity, the frequency, or even the quality aren't all that important....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An idea....<span style="color: #ff0000;">ANY IDEA</span> can make greatness occur, <span style="color: #ff0000;">it just needs a bit of</span> nourishment after being thought...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What separates <span style="color: #ff0000;">acclaim</span> from <span style="color: #ff0000;">an idea</span> is work, <span style="color: #ff0000;">exposure</span>, &amp; evolution...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....not always in that order....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Below are <span style="color: #ff0000;">some great examples of</span> hard work &amp; dedication, dreams &amp; desires, and time, talent &amp; spirit....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Perhaps you have never <span style="color: #ff0000;">had a dream</span> that you've made sure wouldn't die, but I doubt it...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maybe you aren't really striving towards any really important goals right now... &amp; that's fine...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When the time DOES come to revisit those dreams &amp; finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">take a few steps</span> closer to <span style="color: #ff0000;">drawing the picture</span> you want your life to be...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....to put into place <span style="color: #ff0000;">the stories</span> we want to be remembered for...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....to <span style="color: #ff0000;">chose the colours we'll be known for</span> painting inside, outside &amp; around the lines with...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inspirations</span> of which will help you <span style="color: #ff0000;">build a foundation</span> for the panelling which will hold YOUR plans may come from <span style="color: #ff0000;">these bright, energetic, &amp; creative folks below</span>....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...whose visions in their dreams live on through their [not without sweat] works, <span style="color: #ff0000;">floating</span>, absorbable to many, <span style="color: #ff0000;">like a breath released</span> to frolic in the wild, <span style="color: #ff0000;">&amp; play on</span> as their wind...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...probably also planting the seedlings which will continue the process again...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...the harvester becomes the harvest, &amp; the world reaps the benefits...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Like many known to them, and the uncountable not, we <span style="color: #ff0000;">enjoy their works</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">we thank them</span> for their energy, &amp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">we stand VERY PROUD </span>of them!!!.....</span></strong></em></div>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As a survivor of the challenging <span style="color: #ff0000;">24 HOUR COMIC BOOK DAY</span>, he's known&nbsp;for a strong work ethic, reliablity,&nbsp;an encouraging nature,&nbsp;and his&nbsp;patience, which comes in handy in his choice of hockey team...</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When Chris isn't writing (or at the day job) he enjoys long walks on the beach, sunsets or just sitting down to watch a good hockey game (Go Leafs Go!) He lives in Mississauga Ontario with his wife Tina and their two sons Logan and Luke....</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"> 'Kill Shakespeare' </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.....and participant in over THIRTY interviews about said book (including N.P.R's 'Talk Of The Nation), who had just got back from a HUGE promo-tour in New York, NY was HERE in our parking lot Bread & Honey SATURDAY 2010 along with many other creators for our Annual B&H Comic-Con!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our customers send a grand "THANK YOU" your way.... </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Never tried 'KILL SHAKESPEARE' before?....A remarkable read, well worth any price, though thanks to Conor & Company it was re-issued [after a spellbinding sellout performance, jolly good old chums!] for the lowest price of only $1.00 !!!....</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">And, according to total sales numbers, it seems like we [Image Collections] ended up purchasing almost 5% of the entire print run of these perfect introductions to the wonderful place we like to call...</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">'CONOR McCREERY's  MASTERFUL MIND'...</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pick up #1 [while it lasts...he IS a local celeb now :o] today and look for the collected editions to get the whole story! </span></p>

But in doing so, Tony Stark has lost just about everything: his armor, his power — even his very mind. Now, at his absolute lowest point, it will take Tony’s last reservoir of will — and a band of brothers including Thor, Captain America, War Machine and Black Widow — to keep from losing it all and sow the seeds for a brighter tomorrow. Stark Industries’ arms-manufacturing days are over: Tony’s new company, Stark Resilient, is bringing modern tech to the masses without bringing innocent people to their knees. But there’s a competitor on the scene, a mother/daughter team with a very familiar name ready to pick up the slack with an armor called Detroit Steel. They’ve started a deadly game of international intrigue that will bring one of Iron Man’s deadliest foes back into the fray — but for the Hammer girls, that was merely the opening salvo. With War Machine grounded by the Pentagon, Pepper missing the RT-charged heart that made her Rescue and Tony’s Resilient team struggling to put their clean-energy tech into production, they’re about to up the ante. Now, Iron Man’s going to find out just what “resilient” really means.

But the gruesome scene is familiar to Asgardians, and there can be only one culprit: the Fenris Wolf. Long ago, Fenris, son of Loki, was imprisoned for slaughtering an entire Viking village, chained away on an island in Niflhel for all eternity — until agents of Advanced Idea Mechanics freed the wolf in the hope of researching his genetics. With the mythical beast set free upon the world and thirsting for vengeance against his Asgardian captors, the combined might of Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun won’t be enough to protect Asgard. As the Asgardian army assembles for its last stand against the monster, the Warriors Three set off on an epic journey to discover the secret to stopping the beast.

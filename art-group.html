<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">ANOTHER DAY,</span></em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.....SORRY, WE ARE not yelling here, WE JUST FORGOT TO PUSH THE CAPS-LOCK BUTTON &amp; WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK &amp; RE-TYPE ALL OF THIS, WHICH [SINCE WE SOMETIMES WRITE OUT OF ORDER] IS A LOT OF WORK TO DO JUST FOR THE FOUR [....three?...TWO?...] PEOPLE READING THIS.......&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[.....we are about to test your patience...if it gets too much, skip a bit, OK?...]</span></em></strong></span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OR.... MAYBE WE ARE CAUGHT IN OUR OWN WEB OF FUSTRATION THAT INVITED SUPERSTITION &amp; SELF-QUESTIONING ALONG FOR A PURELY PERSONAL SUBTLE FEAR-MONGERING PARTY-FOR-ONE, WHICH,...WHEN TRAPPED IN, SOMEWHAT AGAINST OUR WILL, WE FIND HARD TO ESCAPE....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SOMETIMES, NOT OFTEN, IT'S A BIT EASIER TO MAKE OUTSIDE-YOURSELF EXCUSES, STRATIGICALLY ATTACHED TO SOMETHING OR SOMEONE ELSE, LIKE IN THIS CASE, 'you', WHO'S READING THIS 'SELF-PINPOINTED-DIATRIBE', AS A REASON TO ALLOW US AN 'OUT' WITHOUT COMPROMISING OUR OWN, AT TIMES, FRAGILE EGO....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; SO, IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF 'you', BECAUSE WE CAN EMPHATICALLY FEEL YOUR COLLECTED STRUGGLES [...that's called feeding the [our] ego b-4 diminishing it..&amp; that's not very brave....but it's a step...], WE GIVE OURSELF PERMISSION TO RELEase ourselves from that mini-addiction we had....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></em><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">All THAT aside, most of us might agree, these are trying times indeed, with interuptions of our lives unheard of before, eruptions from places, things &amp; people beyond our control causing our own flare ups, and disruptions unquestionably unique from just a short time ago....these are TEST-worthy far greater than any examinations we have ever had to face....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14pt;"><em>Al-Anon Family Group's Three C's say</em></strong><strong style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14pt;"><em>,</em></strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ...but that doesn't mean that it's any fun when you step in it, or have it poured all around you it seems there is no safe spot to look, let alone walk... The coronavirus currently is causing all sorts of mayhem in the minds of those who are prone to reactionary thoughts and anxiety, so finding proactive yet meaningful distractionary tactics to occupy time is encouraged and needed...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">WE ENCOURAGE YOU to SHARE YOUR VOICE, through the idea of&nbsp;<a href="art-group/342-staysafecomics.html" title="....DON'T BE SHY.....JUST COME RIGHT IN AND CLICK TO LEARN HOW YOU CAN TAKE A BIT OF TIME TO SHARE......THROUGH STAY SAFE COMICS">STAY SAFE COMICS</a>&nbsp;or any other platform, because it is about the collective US, &amp; WHEN WE SHARE, WE LEARN about the JOYS of being heard, WHICH TEACH AN EVEN MORE GRACIOUS &amp; HUMBLING LESSON, the respectful, compassionate, &amp; empathetic BENEFITS OF LISTENING TO UNDERSTAND one another...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.....a tough place to aspire to reach, but well worthy of the grasping.....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If you don't agree, that's great, because that's what communication, conversations, &amp; COMICS ARE FOR, THE SHARING OF IDEAS, THOUGHTS, &amp; OPINIONS, and most of us can relate to having those,</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">but maybe not sharing them....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....in comics...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">yet.... &nbsp;:)</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...more...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">PS....Sorry for PUSHING YOUR BUTTONS earlier........Sure, maybe, in hindsight, it metaphorically represents:</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "the things we all separately hold dear that are locked inside of us, seals of security that when breached, personally define our vulnerabilities, that, when we are 'in-LOCKDOWN', can scare stories that need to be told out of us"</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">......but that's not what we meant, because THIS writer is not that smart!</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">......&amp; it would have nothing to do with....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "the encouragement of the courage it takes to share one's experienced insights in pictures with a few words, or words with a few pictures, through the very easy labeling safe zone of Stay SAFE Comics [ #StaySAFEcomics ]", right?</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....but if it did...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It might be a wonderful safe place to have a discussion around the ideas of:</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> &nbsp;' How far away do we put the fears we feel the most? ',</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;'&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The ones&nbsp;</span></em></strong>we think will hurt us the most, could they somehow be the most far from fear once our will allows us to call for their release? ',</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">' Could what we hide become an essential emblem of our future pride?',</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">.....this wasn't meant to be a mirror held up to the possible higher-pay-grade-than-us definition of self fulfilling prophecy overflowing a cup formerly so spaciously-challenged it was avoiding the burden of seeing on display its intimidating, yet inevitable, immense own talents...really, it wasn't.....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...that''s what ART is for...</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">......With practice, <strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">using the tool of Stay SAFE Comics,&nbsp;</span></em></strong>our minds can counter the actions of self distancing, bridge the gap by finding new therapeutic activities to enhance the idea we are not in this alone, but alone in this greater good towards being stronger apart... </span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maybe, in states of self isolation, reflections of our emotions on a simple page will take us to places they've never sent us to before....</span></em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....they most certainly will for others....</span></em></strong></p>

<p>Our comeback will be bigger than our setback! Comics coming back #BackTheCOMEBACK back the comeback #ComicsAreBack New comics are back #comicsRETURN Read trade share comics comicbooks back shipping</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">#StaySAFEcomics just make sense.....</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">With physical NEW COMICS put on hold, millions can take up the cause...</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"As a calming activity for those who's nerves are 'frying', especially for kids under 85 [ :) ], drawing, &amp; writing can resume sanity as a progressive &amp; brain-stablizing 'thing'......Do them BOTH on the same page, you've got COMICS!"</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Everyone is hurting, we are trying to be proactive, finding ourselves a bit too reactive at times, and eyeballs need some time away from screens every now &amp; then.....so what to do?</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Gettin 'Jiggy With It' [puzzles], #Dicing [games], &amp; old fashioned face to face conversations [at safe distancing range] can ALL help the hours pass, though eventually the need to just 'get away' mentally should be adressed before it&nbsp;manifests itself in unhealthy ["Get Away!!..."] ways....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So #READING can come into play, &amp; this certainly includes reading comics in many forms, a medium, until recently, untapped in most North American's minds, fooled into believing it somehow didn't meet the criteria to handle&nbsp;pertinent information, at least not in their wheelhouse....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>With this variable changing, and the thirst for correct information &amp; experiences about ONE exact subject never having been greater ALL OVER THE WORLD, the need [&amp; demand] has seldom captured the attention of most of humanity</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>As a calming activity for those who's nerves are 'frying', especially for kids under 85 [ :) ], drawing, &amp; writing can resume sanity as a progressive &amp; brain-stablizing 'thing'......Do them BOTH on the same page, you've got COMICS!</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em><strong><em>"So, reach inside yourself to put out the story you'd like, or were born to, share..."&nbsp;</em></strong></em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The attention comics has gathered over the past twenty years, due to hit movies, TV Shows, a massive influx of new comic titles, each building readership across non-traditional lines &amp; ages, is off the charts when it comes to quality, diversity, and a newly found place of rocketing respect....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So a perfect storm to strike lightning, and if ever there was a subject to unite a world where so many ALREADY have found important&nbsp;articulation in sequential art, a&nbsp;tsunami-acting virus health crisis might be it....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Reaching out as a community to motivate others to tell the stories the future will be talking about for a long time, helps&nbsp;alleviate the untrue notion that powerful tools are not within our grasp, even when our arms are restricted in fighting an enemy we can not see....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Stay Safe comics can be a rallying cry for sharing one's insights no matter our age, race, gender, or border....Everyone can find their voice, unrestricted from all but the oldest storytelling tools [ paper &amp; pencil ], yet shared, using the mightiest of our constructions [ the internet ], as a place of release &amp; redemption...</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em> in rebellion against something that held back our physical movement, but not our collective consciousness, a time where we held our breath, because we feared not being allowed to breathe, learning indeed, that together, even apart, we, as one, sighed in relief on a page, as, locked-down, so many of us were finally able to capture our true 'Raison d'&ecirc;tre'....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>So reach inside yourself to put out the story you'd like, or were born to, share... </em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>Making Comics is certainly the easiest, or most complex of the communication arts....</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>It is up to the maker, the decider, the mindful who can play with the page in ways unimaginable to a casual onlooker who doesn't yet realize the potentials of its bare ingredients...&amp; what can grow from a blank page...</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><em>The Stay SAFE comic, a place for anything &amp;everything felt during this huge unintended time out makes moving forward with a plan an awareness we've seldom all shared, or cared to....</em></span></strong></p>

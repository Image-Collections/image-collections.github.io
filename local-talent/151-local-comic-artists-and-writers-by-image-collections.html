<div>[...intro by TM Maple Leaf...]</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Here, on this page, are <span style="color: #ff0000;">some of the people you may wish to aspire to be</span> like...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Most of them, <span style="color: #ff0000;">possibly like you</span>, have had <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreams</span> to reach out by harvesting from within, taking stands by <span style="color: #ff0000;">giving the world</span> pieces &amp; places of themselves they thought had long sat dormant enough...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Like many <span style="color: #ff0000;">reading this</span>, they had been <span style="color: #ff0000;">spawning ideas</span>, sometimes only every now &amp; then, sometimes daily or hourly...sometimes hundreds of them, sometimes only a couple, or even, just perhaps, only <span style="color: #ff0000;">one</span>....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The quantity, the frequency, or even the quality aren't all that important....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An idea....<span style="color: #ff0000;">ANY IDEA</span> can make greatness occur, <span style="color: #ff0000;">it just needs a bit of</span> nourishment after being thought...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">What separates <span style="color: #ff0000;">acclaim</span> from <span style="color: #ff0000;">an idea</span> is work, <span style="color: #ff0000;">exposure</span>, &amp; evolution...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....not always in that order....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Below are <span style="color: #ff0000;">some great examples of</span> hard work &amp; dedication, dreams &amp; desires, and time, talent &amp; spirit....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Perhaps you have never <span style="color: #ff0000;">had a dream</span> that you've made sure wouldn't die, but I doubt it...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Maybe you aren't really striving towards any really important goals right now... &amp; that's fine...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">When the time DOES come to revisit those dreams &amp; finally <span style="color: #ff0000;">take a few steps</span> closer to <span style="color: #ff0000;">drawing the picture</span> you want your life to be...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....to put into place <span style="color: #ff0000;">the stories</span> we want to be remembered for...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">....to <span style="color: #ff0000;">chose the colours we'll be known for</span> painting inside, outside &amp; around the lines with...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Some of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inspirations</span> of which will help you <span style="color: #ff0000;">build a foundation</span> for the panelling which will hold YOUR plans may come from <span style="color: #ff0000;">these bright, energetic, &amp; creative folks below</span>....</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...whose visions in their dreams live on through their [not without sweat] works, <span style="color: #ff0000;">floating</span>, absorbable to many, <span style="color: #ff0000;">like a breath released</span> to frolic in the wild, <span style="color: #ff0000;">&amp; play on</span> as their wind...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...probably also planting the seedlings which will continue the process again...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">...the harvester becomes the harvest, &amp; the world reaps the benefits...</span></strong></em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Like many known to them, and the uncountable not, we <span style="color: #ff0000;">enjoy their works</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">we thank them</span> for their energy, &amp; <span style="color: #ff0000;">we stand VERY PROUD </span>of them!!!.....</span></strong></em></div>
